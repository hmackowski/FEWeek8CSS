      <p id="homeP">Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," are creatures that
        inhabit the
        Pokémon world. They were first introduced in 1996 by Nintendo, Game
        Freak, and Creatures as a video game franchise. Since then, Pokémon has
        expanded into various forms of media, including trading card games, an
        animated TV series, movies, and more.</p>
